# Team West(will): UC Pool

This project delves into the development process of UC Pool, an innovative carpooling app designed to address transportation challenges among UCLA students. The project's progression is delineated through phases encompassing initial research and literature review, structured interviews, low-fidelity and high-fidelity designs, iterative improvements driven by user feedback, and extensive usability testing.

The design process highlights the shift in focus from events to trip-centric functionalities, integration of enhanced safety features, introduction of price transparency, and refined pick-up point mechanisms. Prototyping methods involved the creation of interactive platforms for usability testing, conducted across two phases with UCLA students. Findings underscored the app's unique blend of public transportation and student car options, while also recommending enhancements such as improved safety features and driver-centric price transparency.

This project underscores the pivotal role of user feedback and data-driven methodologies in sculpting design iterations, ensuring alignment with user needs. This iterative process, driven by proactive integration of user insights, culminates in the creation of an intuitive and community-focused carpooling solution tailored specifically for the UCLA student community.
